# Beam Analysis and Visualization

This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing and visualizing beam behavior under uniformly distributed loads. It calculates and plots **shear force**, **bending moment**, and **bending stress distributions** along the length of the beam. The project demonstrates structural mechanics concepts and visualization techniques, useful for engineering students and professionals.

## Features
- **Shear Force Distribution**: Calculates and plots the variation of shear force along the beam.
- **Bending Moment Distribution**: Computes and visualizes the bending moment curve.
- **Stress Analysis**: Evaluates bending stresses based on moment of inertia and neutral axis distance.
- **Annotations on Graphs**: Highlights key points like maximum shear force, zero shear force, and maximum bending moment.


## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- `matplotlib` library for plotting

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Srinivas26k/engineering-simulations.git
   cd beam-analysis

2. Install required Python libraries:
    bash
    Copy code
    pip install matplotlib

### Usage
        1. Test the Calculations
            Run the test_script.py to verify the shear force, bending moment, and stress calculations:

            bash
            Copy code
            python tests/test_script.py

        2. Visualize the Results
            Generate and view plots for shear force and bending moment distributions:

            bash
            Copy code
            python visualization/visualize_results.py

            The plots will be saved in the results/ directory.

        3. Customize Beam Parameters
            You can modify the beam length, load intensity, and cross-section dimensions in test_script.py or visualize_results.py to analyze different cases.

            Example Output
            Shear Force Distribution

            Bending Moment Distribution

            Applications
