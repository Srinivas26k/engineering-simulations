# Engineering Simulations

A Python-based simulation tool for structural analysis, designed to calculate and visualize:
- **Bending stresses**
- **Shear force and bending moment distributions**
- **Deflection curves**
- **Vibration analysis** (coming soon!)

This tool supports multiple load cases and beam configurations, providing insights into structural performance under various scenarios.

## Features

### 1. **Structural Analysis**:
- Calculate bending stress, shear force, and bending moment for beams.
- Visualize results with annotations for critical points.

### 2. **Dynamic Simulations** *(Planned)*:
- Simulate beam vibrations under dynamic loading.
- Calculate natural frequencies and mode shapes.

### 3. **Interactive Visualizations**:
- Utilize Matplotlib for static plots and Plotly/Dash for interactive visualizations.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Srinivas26k/engineering-simulations.git
   cd engineering-simulations

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
- Beam Analysis: Run the beam_analysis.py script to calculate bending stresses, shear forces, and bending moments for a given beam.
- Testing: To verify the shear force, bending moment, and stress calculations, run:
  ```bash
  python tests/test_script.py
- Visualization: Generate and view plots for shear force and bending moment distributions:
  ```bash
  python visualization/visualize_results.py
The plots will be saved in the results/ directory.

### Customization
You can modify the beam length, load intensity, and cross-section dimensions in test_script.py or visualize_results.py to analyze different cases.

## Add the requirements.txt
The requirements.txt should include the following dependencies:
numpy
matplotlib
scipy
sympy
jupyter

- To install them locally:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

### Applications
- Engineering Coursework: Useful for students learning structural analysis.
