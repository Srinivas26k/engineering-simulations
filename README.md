# Engineering Simulations

A Python-based simulation tool for structural analysis, designed to calculate and visualize:
- **Bending stresses**
- **Shear force and bending moment distributions**
- **Deflection curves**
- **Vibration analysis** (coming soon!)

This tool supports multiple load cases and beam configurations, providing insights into structural performance under various scenarios.

## Features

### 1. **Structural Analysis**:
- Calculate bending stress, shear force, and bending moment for beams.
- Visualize results with annotations for critical points.

### 2. **Dynamic Simulations** *(Planned)*:
- Simulate beam vibrations under dynamic loading.
- Calculate natural frequencies and mode shapes.

### 3. **Interactive Visualizations**:
- Utilize Matplotlib for static plots and Plotly/Dash for interactive visualizations.
